# Machine_Learning
Cimate Wins is interested in using machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change around Europe and, potentially, the world. This task aims to leverage machine learning techniques to analyze European climate data, identifying patterns and trends that could provide critical insights into how climate change is impacting different regions.
This task involves developing and applying machine learning models to identify the most effective resources and datasets for predicting climate change. By doing so, Climate Wins seeks to pinpoint which variables—such as temperature fluctuations, precipitation & wind patterns or global radiation—are the most relevant in forecasting future climate conditions.
Ultimately, Climate Wins is looking to create a robust and scalable framework that can be applied not only in Europe but also adapted to different regions around the world. This framework will empower stakeholders with actionable insights to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change and protect the well-being of communities globally.

## **Objective:**
Use machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change while working as a data analyst at ClimateWins, a European nonprofit organization.

## **Data**
* Data set based on weather observations from 18 different European weather stations from the late 1800s to 2022.
* Includes daily recordings for temperature, wind speed, snow, global radiation, and more.
* Data set collected by: European Climate Assessment & Data Set Project

## **Tools**
Python:
  * Pandas: for data analization
  * Seaborn: for data visualization
  * Matplotlib: for data visualization
  * Numpy: for mathematical equations
  * Scikit-learn:
    * sklearn.model_selection: for splitting a dataset into training and testing sets
    * sklearn.metrics: for computing the accuracy of the model and computing/displaying the confision matrix
    * sklearn.neighbors: for implementing the KNN algorithm for classification tasks
    * sklearn.multioutput: for fitting a single classifier to multiple target outputs in classification tasks

Algorithms and Optimizations:
  * Gradient Descent
  * Classification-Based Algorithms:
    * K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
    * Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
    * Decision Tree
